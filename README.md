# CocoaBindingDryView-ReusableViews
A view of type DryView allows you to have as many views (and nested views) that uses cocoa binding without a single line of code!
A DryView is a custom view that given a nibName, will load views from it into the DryView and if you are using Cocoa Binding, you can reference your NSObjectController to bind your properties to your precous views!
Views contraints!! no problemo, the DryView's content will just follow your view's contraints as if they were created in the views you are loading in

## Go from reusable simple views:
